# Statistics and Probability Final Assignment: Sales Leads Analysis
In this [project](https://github.com/Rina-Irene-arch/Statistics_and_Probability_NAYA_Assignment/blob/main/Naya_DRA_Statistics_Final_Assignment_Rina_Rafalski_D_Fin.ipynb) we analyze data from 10,000 sales leads to examine the company's sales performance of a recently launched health insurance product.
The [data source](https://github.com/Rina-Irene-arch/Statistics_and_Probability_NAYA_Assignment/blob/main/DRA%20Final%20Assignment%20Data.csv) of gathered the data contains the following parameters:
- ID – a unique identifier of each customer
- AGE GROUP – the age group of the customer
- CHANNEL OF SALE – either “internet” or “phone”, depending on where the customers left their contact
details
- SALES – an indicator variable (1 – successful sale, 0 – unsuccessful sale)
